    <div>
        <p>This is a custom browser engine written in<span style="color: brown">Java.</span></p>
        <p>While web pages may not look exactly as you're used to, its architecture is similar to that of large commercial browsers.</p>
        <p>It can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make HTTP and HTTPS requests;</li>
            <li>Parse HTML;</li>
            <li>Distinguish <i>different</i> types of <a>elements</a>;</li>
            <li><span style="color: blueviolet">Apply</span> <span style="color: cornflowerblue">styles</span> <span style="color: green;">to page</span> <span style="color: darkgoldenrod">elements;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p><br />This project was heavily inspired by the online book <a href="https://browser.engineering/">Web Browser Engineering,</a><span></span> which I highly recommend reading. It demonstrates that even the most complex systems can be broken down into components and understood by anyone.</p>
        <p>This browser is built purely for fun and learning, but if you find it interesting, I'd really appreciate a GitHub star! ðŸš€</p>
